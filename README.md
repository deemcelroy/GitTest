<h3>Angel Hair With Olive Oil & Lemon</h3>
Ingredients
1 tablespoon kosher salt plus additional for sprinkling
8 ounces angel hair pasta
4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
4 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons chopped Italian parsley
2 cups Parmesan cheese
1/3 cup chopped toasted walnuts, place chopped walnuts in 400 F oven for 1 min.
Walnut oil or olive oil
Cracked pepper
Kosher salt
2 teaspoons red pepper flakes (optional)
2 tablespoon chopped parsley
2 tablespoons chopped mint
Zest from 1 lemon
1 lemon, cut into wedges

Instructions
<ul>
	<li>Pre-heat the oven to 200 F.</li>
<li>When the oven has reached 200 F. turn it off and place the 6 pasta bowls you are going to use for serving the angel hair inside.</li>
<li>Fill a pasta pot with at least 2-1/2 quarts of water, and add 1 tablespoon of kosher salt. When the water has come to a boil, add the angel hair. Angel hair cooks quickly (about 3 to 5 minutes); do not overcook. The pasta continues to cook after you take it out of the water, and you don’t want to end up with soft, soggy pasta, so test for doneness by tasting a few strands. They should still have a tiny crunch when you bite into them.</li>
<li>Take the angel hair out of the water with tongs, and place it in a large warm pasta bowl that has been rinsed in hot water to take the chill off. Do not discard the pasta water.</li>
<li>Into the bowl with the angel hair, add the olive oil, lemon juice, and parsley. Mix gently with the tongs; then add a ladleful of the pasta water and mix again.</li>
<li>Remove the pasta bowls, from the oven, and divide the angel hair among them. Sprinkle a generous amount of Parmesan cheese (2 to 3 tablespoons) over the top of each serving. Add about 2 teaspoons of chopped toasted walnuts to each serving, and drizzle on some walnut or olive oil. Crack pepper to taste and sprinkle a teeny amount of kosher or truffle salt and a pinch of red pepper flakes over each serving. Distribute the parsley, mint, and lemon zest evenly over the servings, and serve with a lemon wedge.</li>
</ul>
